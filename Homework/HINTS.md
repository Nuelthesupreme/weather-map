# Hints and Tips :tada:

1. We're going to be using the apis provided by OpenWeatherAPI so it's really important we familiarise ourselves with how that looks, what kind of endpoint's are available?

   > What different query parameters do the endpoints need? We've done a lot of this before in the Bujumbura activity so there won't be an fancy example.html.

1. Looks like the requirements from a non "User Story perspective are:"

   1. Searching for a city, which stores this search to localStorage in the sidebar
   1. Should be able to click a city from the saved ones in the side bar.
   1. The current day's weather, humidity, wind speed
   1. 5 day forecast for the location

1. Don't rush to try and get the data from the api, that's the last step, you need to setup your JavaScript/jQuery to manipulate the DOM ready for your api information.

1. There's a lot of features in the user stories, it's worth mapping theses out to ensure nothing gets missed.

1. There's no HTML or CSS for this, nor is there a JS file, probably easiest to make use of Bootstrap for this homework in the interest of time and allow time to focus on the AJAX calls!

# Submission Checklist :rocket:

1. Ensure that you submit both a link to your homework repo **and** your live github pages link.
   > Check for sneaky console errors!
2. Ensure what you've submitted works when you grade it yourself against the:

   - The user stories provided
   - The acceptance criteria's provided.

3. Make sure your homework repo has a quality README that _you_ have written, and provide screenshots **and a github pages** link!

4. Commit after most changes, all that code doesn't just appear first time :wink:

5. **Comment that JavaScript code :pray:**
